/**
 The embedded JDBC driver (Type 4) for GemFireXD.
 <P>
 The driver automatically supports the correct JDBC specification version
 for the Java Virtual Machine's environment.
 <UL>
 <LI> JDBC 4.0 - Java SE 6
 <LI> JDBC 3.0 - Java 2 - JDK 1.4, J2SE 5.0
 </UL>

 <P>
 Loading this JDBC driver boots the database engine
 within the same Java virtual machine.
 <P>
 The correct code to load the GemFireXD engine using this driver is
 (with approriate try/catch blocks):
 <PRE>
 Class.forName("com.pivotal.gemfirexd.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver").newInstance();

 // or

 new com.pivotal.gemfirexd.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver();


 </PRE>
 When loaded in this way, the class boots the actual JDBC driver indirectly.
 The JDBC specification recommends the Class.ForName method without the .newInstance()
 method call, but adding the newInstance() guarantees
 that GemFireXD will be booted on any Java Virtual Machine.

 <P>
 Note that you do not need to manually load the driver this way if you are
 running on Jave SE 6 or later. In that environment, the driver will be
 automatically loaded for you when your application requests a connection to
 a GemFireXD database.
 <P>
 Any initial error messages are placed in the PrintStream
 supplied by the DriverManager. If the PrintStream is null error messages are
 sent to System.err. Once the GemFireXD engine has set up an error
 logging facility (by default to gemfirexd.log) all subsequent messages are sent to it.
 <P>
 By convention, the class used in the Class.forName() method to
 boot a JDBC driver implements java.sql.Driver.

 This class is not the actual JDBC driver that gets registered with
 the Driver Manager. It proxies requests to the registered GemFireXD JDBC driver.
 <P>
 This is class is only for backward compatibility. Use
 {@link io.snappydata.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver} instead.

/**
 This is the dummy driver which is registered with the DriverManager and
 which is autoloaded by JDBC4. Loading this class will NOT automatically
 boot the GemFireXD engine, but it will register this class as a valid
 Driver with the DriverManager.
 Instead, the engine boots lazily when you ask for a
 Connection. Alternatively, you can force the engine to boot as follows:

 <PRE>
 Class.forName("com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver").newInstance();

 // or

 new com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver();


 </PRE>
 <P>
 This is class is only for backward compatibility. Use
 {@link io.snappydata.jdbc.AutoloadedDriver} instead.

/**
 * <p>
 * This is GemFireXD's network XADataSource for use with JDBC4.0.
 * </p>
 * An XADataSource is a factory for XAConnection objects.  It represents a
 * RM in a DTP environment.  An object that implements the XADataSource
 * interface is typically registered with a JNDI service provider.
 *
 * <P>
 * ClientXADataSource40 supports the JDBC 4.0 specification
 * for the J2SE 6.0 Java Virtual Machine environment. Use ClientXADataSource
 * if your application runs in the following environments:
 * <UL>
 * <LI> JDBC 3.0 - Java 2 - JDK 1.4, J2SE 5.0
 * <LI> JDBC 2.0 - Java 2 - JDK 1.2,1.3
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P>ClientXADataSource40 is serializable and referenceable.</p>
 *
 * <P>See ClientDataSource40 for DataSource properties.</p>

/**
 * ClientConnectionPoolDataSource40 is a factory for PooledConnection objects.
 * An object that implements this interface
 * will typically be registered with a naming service that is based on the
 * Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). Use this factory
 * if your application runs under JDBC4.0.
 * Use
 * ClientConnectionPoolDataSource, instead, if your application runs under
 * JDBC3.0 or JDBC2.0, that is, on the following Java Virtual Machines:
 * <p/>
 * <UL>
 * <LI> JDBC 3.0 - Java 2 - JDK 1.4, J2SE 5.0
 * <LI> JDBC 2.0 - Java 2 - JDK 1.2,1.3

/**
 * Base class for iterators for regions that are backed by disk regions and may
 * have entries overflowed to disk. There are two modes of operation possible
 * for disk region iterators.
 * <p>
 * a) The first mode is iteration over a single DiskRegion where the in-memory
 * entries of the region are returned first, and then the first hasNext() call
 * as false should have the caller invoke {@link #initDiskIterator()} which
 * will then cause the iterator to start returning overflowed disk entries.
 * <p>
 * b) In the second mode the iteration is to be done over multiple disk regions.
 * Here in-memory entries of all the regions should be returned first which is
 * done by setting the region repeatedly using {@link #setRegion(LocalRegion)}
 * after the hasNext() has returned as false. At the end of all in-memory entry
 * iteration, the {@link #initDiskIterator()} should be invoked by the caller
 * at the end after all regions are done, and the final iteration by
 * implementations should be over the overflowed entries for all the regions
 * that were set by {@link #setRegion(LocalRegion)} during in-memory iteration.
